/**
 * 1035. Uncrossed Lines
 * We write the integers of A and B (in the order they are given) on two separate horizontal lines.
 * <p>
 * Now, we may draw connecting lines: a straight line connecting two numbers A[i] and B[j] such that:
 * <p>
 * A[i] == B[j];
 * The line we draw does not intersect any other connecting (non-horizontal) line.
 * Note that a connecting lines cannot intersect even at the endpoints: each number can only belong to one connecting line.
 * <p>
 * Return the maximum number of connecting lines we can draw in this way.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Input: A = [1,4,2], B = [1,2,4]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: We can draw 2 uncrossed lines as in the diagram.
 * We cannot draw 3 uncrossed lines, because the line from A[1]=4 to B[2]=4 will intersect the line from A[2]=2 to B[1]=2.
 * Example 2:
 * <p>
 * Input: A = [2,5,1,2,5], B = [10,5,2,1,5,2]
 * Output: 3
 * Example 3:
 * <p>
 * Input: A = [1,3,7,1,7,5], B = [1,9,2,5,1]
 * Output: 2
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Note:
 * <p>
 * 1 <= A.length <= 500
 * 1 <= B.length <= 500
 * 1 <= A[i], B[i] <= 2000
